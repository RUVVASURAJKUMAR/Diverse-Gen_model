Diverse Generative Models: Exploring GANs, VAEs, and DDPM :-
An Assignment as part of Computer Vision course, under Sumohana S. Channappayya
Investigates GANs (DCGAN), VAEs, and DDPM for generating realistic MNIST images.
Conducts qualitative and quantitative comparison of outputs, assessing quality, diversity, and mode collapse tendencies.
Specifcally examines intentional mode collapse in GANs to understand and mitigate this issue
